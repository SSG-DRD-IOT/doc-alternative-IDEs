## MacOSX

1. Download and Install the Atom Editor from [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)
2. [Install the Nuclide Plugin](docs/install-nuclide.md). **You will need to install a specific version that matches the version of the Nuclide server on your remote device**. This means that rather than using the plugin manager in Atom, you **must** use the command line to install a specific version.
3. [Setup your connection to the remote computer](docs/nuclide-remote-connection.md)
